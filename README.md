# 💻Google Homepage Clone with SASS

This is a customized Google homepage clone where I've replicated the main features of the Google homepage and added a personalized touch. The project not only mimics the familiar layout and functionalities of Google's homepage but also incorporates the use of SASS for enhanced and modular styling.
